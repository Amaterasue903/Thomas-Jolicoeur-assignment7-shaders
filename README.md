# Thomas-Jolicoeur-assignment7-shaders

I chose to take a look at my old work and throw a shader over it. More specifically my assignment 5 piece, I enjoyed the feeling of observing the piece but wanted to find a way to use shaders to add a after affect to the overall piece. What i came up with was entirely different, I was able to created this after trail affect that almost paints over what came before it. This in a way amplifies what I wanted to show off about the differnet in worth when it comes to currencies and most certaintlyaddst to the feel when looking at the piece, but also takes away from the original intention by making it harder to read as a piece with mean. I struggled working with shaders but with help from others I was able to overcome this struggle and make something I'd frankly use as my wallpaper.
